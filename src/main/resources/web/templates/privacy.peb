        <p>SnowCaptcha is designed to collect and process as little data as possible while still achieving its goal of
        stopping bots. This page outlines what data SnowCaptcha collects, processes, and shares with third-parties.</p>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>SnowCaptcha collects your IP address and stores a hash of the prefix (/24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6) for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Your IP address may also be sent to <a href="https://www.projecthoneypot.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Project Honey Pot</a>
        to check if bot behavior was detected from your IP address recently.</p>
